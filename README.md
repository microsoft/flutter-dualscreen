# Flutter Dual Screen

This contains Microsoft's offerings to streamline foldable and dual-screen development using Flutter. This plugin will work on any platform, but only Android actually has foldable and dual screen devices.

Flutter already has support for foldable and dual-screen devices in the form of [MediaQuery Display Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/flutter/mediaquery). In addition to that, this plugin offers:

- The [TwoPane widget](#twopane-widget), which relies on display features coming from MediaQuery.
- Access to the [hinge angle sensor data](#hinge-angle-sensor), which for performance concerns, was not included in MediaQuery.

# TwoPane Widget

This layout has two child panes, which can be shown side-by-side, above-and-below, or a single pane can be prioritized. The relative size of the two pane widgets can be adjusted proportionally; and on dual-screen devices the boundary snaps to the hinge area.

## TwoPane API

```dart
class TwoPane {
  const TwoPane({
    Widget startPane,
    Widget endPane,
    double paneProportion,
    TwoPanePriority panePriority,
    Axis direction,
    TextDirection? textDirection,
    VerticalDirection verticalDirection,
    EdgeInsets padding,
    Set<TwoPaneAllowedOverrides> allowedOverrides,
  });
}
```

Properties of TwoPane:

- `startPane` - Start pane, which can sit on the left for left-to-right layouts, or at the top for top-to-bottom layouts. If `panePriority` is `start` and there is no hinge, this is the only visible pane.
- `endPane` - End pane, which can sit on the right for left-to-right layouts, or at the bottom for top-to-bottom layouts. If `panePriority` is `end`, and there is no hinge, this is the only visible pane.
- `paneProportion` - Proportion of the screen occupied by the start pane. The end pane takes over the rest of the space. A value of 0.5 will make the two panes equal. This property is ignored for displays with a hinge, in which case each pane takes over one screen.
- `panePriority` - Whether to show only one the start pane, end pane, or both. This property is ignored for displays with a hinge, in which case `both` panes are visible.
- `direction` - Whether to stack the two panes verticaly or horizontaly, similar to [Flex direction](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Flex/direction.html). This property is ignored for displays with a hinge, in which case the direction is `horizontal` for vertical hinges and `vertical` for horizontal hinges.
- `textDirection` - When panes are laid out horizontally, this determines which one goes on the left. Behaves the same as [Flex textDirection](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Flex/textDirection.html)
- `verticalDirection` - When panes are laid out vertically, this determines which one goes at the top. Behaves the same as [Flex verticalDirection](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Flex/verticalDirection.html)
- `padding` - The padding between TwoPane and the edges of the screen. If there is spacing between TwoPane and the root MediaQuery, `padding` is used to correctly align the two panes to the hinge.
- `allowedOverrides` - The parameters that TwoPane is allowed to override when a separating display feature is found. By default, it contains `paneProportion`, `direction` and `panePriority`, allowing all possible overrides.

> Most of the parameters provided to TwoPane are ignored when the device has a hinge. This means that you can focus on how the layout works on large screens like tablets and desktops, while also having it adapt well to the dual-screen form factor by default.

## TwoPane example

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return TwoPane(
    startPane: _widgetA(),
    endPane: _widgetB(),
    paneProportion: 0.3,
    panePriority: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width > 500 ? TwoPanePriority.both : TwoPanePriority.first,
  );
}
```

This sample code produces the results at the beginning of this article:

- On **Surface Duo**, widget A and widget B both take one screen.

- On a **tablet** or **desktop**, widget A takes 30% of the screen while widget B takes the remaining 70%.

- On a **small phone** which is less than 500 logical pixels wide, only widget A is visible.

# Hinge angle sensor

Foldable and dual-screen devices have a hinge between the two moving parts of the screen. This hinge has a sensor, reporting the angle between the parts of the screen. For example, when these parts lay flat to form a continuous surface, the hinge angle reports a 180 deg angle.

> The hinge angle is used to determine the [device posture](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables#postures). If you're looking to write code that depends on the device posture, we recommend using the functionality provided by [MediaQuery Display Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/flutter/mediaquery) instead.

## Hinge angle API

To use this plugin, add `dual_screen` as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

This will allow you to import DualScreenInfo `import 'package:dual_screen/dual_screen.dart';`

DualScreenInfo exposes 2 static properties:

- `hingeAngleEvents`: Broadcast stream of events from the device hinge angle sensor. If the device is not equipped with a hinge angle sensor, the stream produces no events.
- `hasHingeAngleSensor`: Future returning true if the device has a hinge angle sensor. Alternatively, if your app already uses `MediaQuery.displayFeatures` or `MediaQuery.hinge` to adapt to foldable or dual-screen form factors, you can safely assume the hinge angle sensor exists and that `hingeAngleEvents` produces usable values.

## Hinge angle example

```dart
import 'package:dual_screen/dual_screen.dart';

DualScreenInfo.hingeAngleEvents.listen((double hingeAngle) {
  print(hingeAngle);
});

DualScreenInfo.hasHingeAngleSensor.then((bool hasHingeSensor) {
  print(hasHingeSensor);
});
```

## Testing

Examples on how to mock the hinge angle or display features can be found in the [test](https://github.com/microsoft/flutter-dualscreen/tree/main/test) folder.

Testing the hinge angle sensor functionality can be done using the [Surface Duo emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/android/emulator/get-started) or one of the [foldable emulators available in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables#emulators). Both emulators provide a hinge angle virtual sensor. The Surface Duo emulator is the only one with two separate screens.
